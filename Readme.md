# Assessment 0 - Health and Medical Data Literature Review

## Project Group

- Ethan
- Andre
- Josh
- Geraint

We have an equal equity split between everyone.

## Reading order

The report takes the structure of one file as our repost: `report.ipynb`.

## Evidence

We all performed our own general research of health and medical data with code examples within the main report.
Everyone's section is labeled in the structure.
The versioning of google colab can show everyone's contribution as well as consistent pushing to github of the main report.
