# Assessment 1 - Investigating Binary Classifiers on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.

## Project Group

- Ethan
- Andre
- Josh
- Geraint

We have an equal equity split between everyone.

## Reading order

The report takes the structure of one file as our report: `report.ipynb`.
Some reflections are found inside the reflections folder.

## Evidence

We all researched and discussed the dataset and performance metrics. We each chose a specific type of classification method to research and investigate further.
Geraint looked at logistic regression; Andre analysed data for colinearity and investigated support vector machines; Josh worked on exploratory data analysis as well as decision trees and random forests; and Ethan worked on feed-forward neural networks.

Although there is no distinct documentation, everyone's section is labeled in the report structure and the versioning of Google Colab can show everyone's contributions as well as consistent pushes of the report to GitHub.
